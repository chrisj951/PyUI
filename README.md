Open Source replacement for MainUI on Miyoo and Trim Devices
and potentially others in the future


### Features
- Greatly improved themeing support
    -   Most existing themes should also be compatible
    -   Press 'A' on the selected Theme to start modifying it
        -   Full information to come later
- Faster interface than stock Miyoo (No longer need to press to refresh roms)
- Full compatability with stock Miyoo apps/emulators
- PortMaster Support bundled

NOTE: This currently uses the stock OS emulators / setup. In the future this may change
NOTE: While most functionality is built into PyUI, there is an option in settings to boot into the stock menu. This is to allow things like language support for the stock emulators, as well as analog stick calibration

| Device | Added | Status |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Miyoo Flip -- Any 2025 FW | Initial | Work in progress |

### Installation
1) Setup a microSD card with the Stock OS (Can be downloaded here https://github.com/spruceUI/spruceOS/releases/flip0.0)
2) Download the most recent build https://github.com/chrisj951/PyUI/releases
3) Unzip the recent build on top of the sdcard with the stock setup, overwriting all files

NOTE: This uses the same install method as MinUI. There is a way to run it without flashing anything 
which I will make available if enough people are interested in that
