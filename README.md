### Installation
1) Setup a microSD card with the Stock OS (Can be downloaded here https://github.com/spruceUI/spruceOS/releases/flip0.0)
2) Download the most recent build https://github.com/chrisj951/PyUI/releases
3) Unzip the recent build on top of the sdcard with the stock setup, overwriting all files

NOTE: This uses the same install method as MinUI. There is a way to run it without flashing anything 
which I will make available if enough people are interested in that
